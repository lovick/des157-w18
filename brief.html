            <h1>Project Brief</h1>
            <h2>Topic Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Every person on our planet has to eat; it is a key requirement for survival, as we need food to fuel our bodies. Some people like eating food. There is a great deal of variety in the cuisines of different cultures. American food is often very bread and meat heavy, with more fried food than others. The classic cheeseburger and fries is a perfect example of this. On the other hand, Japanese cuisine focuses more on noodles, vegetables, and rice with dishes like ramen and sushi. It can be hard to discover what people eat in other countries, and sometimes what you can find is not authentic to what the food is like.
            </p>

            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>
                The ideal person for this project to target would most importantly be interested in trying new kinds of food. This is important. Ideally, they will also have some amount of expendable income. To try new types of food, you must be willing to either go to a restaurant and pay for the food, or to find a recipe and cook it yourself. Depending on the recipe, you may not have the necessary ingredients, and the ability to afford special ingredients like this is key. Finally, they need to know why they are looking to try something new. They need to be interested in how other cultures live and eat and be willing to accept some of the cultural differences that may be there.
            </p>

            <h2>Goals of the Project</h2>
            <p>
                This project will aim to present users with a sort of guidebook that gives them the ability to see food from many different cultures. They will be able to quickly find either local restaurants with kinds of food they may not have tried before, or recipes and instructions for making these kinds of food at home. Ideally, it would also provide information regarding where to find some of the ingredients that may be harder to find in a standard grocery store. This whole system will likely work based on a built data store of information regarding all sorts of different kinds of food, and it will need to be curated in order to ensure the quality of the content is high.
            </p>

            <h2>Communication Strategy</h2>
            <p>
                The primary method of communication should be visual. The best way to make a new kind of food appealing is by showing pictures of it. Gifs or short videos could also be used, as a little bit of motion to draw the eye works well. Visuals are a key component of any cookbook or other food source of information. There is a key reason that Instagram is so full of food pictures; they are appealing, and this concept is exactly what should be capitalized upon. Hopefully, the flavor text and recipe instructions can also be made to be interesting instead of dry or dull.
            </p>

            <h2>Goals for the Overall Look and Feel</h2>
            <p>
                The overall appearance of the project should use relatively neutral colors, with maybe one or two spot colors as a way of providing emphasis. The real emphasis should be on the food, the pictures that are intended to draw the viewer in. This emphasis means that the images should be large, with little to nothing laid on top of them. The more visual space is left for the food, the better. I feel a good, sans-serif display type will probably work well for this project; it will keep the overall atmosphere from feeling formal and has a modern feel to it. This fits, as the idea of being very globally and culturally sensitive is a modern one.
