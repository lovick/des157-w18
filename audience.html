            <p class="right">This is Phil. Phil is a millenial food enthusiast who wants to travel and experience authentic food froma variety of cultures. He has enough expendable income to afford to spend a decent amount of money on food.</p>
            <p class="right">Phil is in his mid 20s, and lives in an urban city. He has some level of college education, but no children of his own yet.</p>
            <p>Phil posts pictures of his food on social media platforms like Snapchat and Instagram. He has some technical skill, but nothing too advanced; enough to use a web browser.</p>
            <p>Phil wants to travel, and is looking for ideas for where to visit. He would use this website to see the cuisines of various cultures, and potentially come up with ideas and opportunities to try these foods. This may include seeing local places with authentic cuisine, or events and opportunities to visit other cultures.</p>
