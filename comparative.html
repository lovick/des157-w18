            <p>I’ll be looking at and comparing two food-centric websites, <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/">cooking.nytimes.com</a> and <a href="https://www.yummly.com/">yummly.com.</a></p>
            <h2>New York Times Cooking</h2>
            <img src="images/cookingnytimes.png" alt="The New York Times Cooking home page" >
            <p>Beginning with the New York Times website, the first thing the user is greeted with upon opening the site is an almost full screen image of whatever their featured recipe is; at the time of writing this, it’s a Stir-Fried Pork and Pineapple recipe, shown on a well-lit wood table, in a wooden bowl with chopsticks and various other aspects of the cooking process in the background. This serves to immediately entice visitors into clicking deeper into the website; it’s a good tactic to immediately engage users and encourage them to try the shown recipe.</p>
            <p>Further down the page, the website provides more suggested recipes. They’re labeled as being suggested by a “Sam”, which helps to give the website a more human feeling. Including people’s names seems to be a method through which they’re trying to give the suggestions more credence. Below this, there are links to lists of various recipes, all in similar categories. For example, there’s one titled “20 Staff Favorites Ready in Under an Hour”, which has 20 recipes on it. Below this, there are some basic guides for cooking, and finally a footer with a field prompting to sign up for their newsletter.</p>
            <p>Clicking into a recipe brings you to a page with a brief description, as well as an image and some broad information about the recipe. The “Basic Pot Roast” I clicked on serves 6 to 8 people and takes 2 hours and 30 minutes to cook. Below this section, there’s an ingredient list floated left, and a list of directions to the right. Finally, there’s a comments section at the bottom of the page that allows a user to read the tips or other feedback other people who have made the recipe may have had.</p>
            <p>One major thing that stands out about this format for showcasing recipes is the emphasis on images. The website is designed similarly to the main New York Times website, and is primarily black text on a white background, with images allowed to stand on their own. There’s a great use of whitespace, and the site has a very clean aesthetic as a result. This does a great job of putting the emphasis on the food. In addition, when a user searches they’re offered options to filter by culture, but this is a small aspect. In a version of something like this, it would be good to put more emphasis on the culture of the dish, and maybe incorporate such a feature into the homepage of the website.</p>

            <h2>Yummly</h2>
            <img src="images/yummly.png" alt="The Yummly homepage" >
            <p>Yummly’s website has a similar format to the New York Times website in some ways but differs in a few key factors. To begin, the Yummly website has a large search bar at the top, just before a tiled window of a wide variety of recipes. Each of these recipes is primarily a large tile, with a recipe name, author, and some sort of commentary or annotation in the top of the tile. There’s also a “Yum” button which enables a rating system on their website. Just above this set of tiles, there’s a set of various categories, which changes what tiles are shown. Scrolling down the page, the website doesn’t appear to have a footer, and stops scrolling with just a row of tiles adjacent to the bottom of the browser window.</p>
            <p>Clicking into a recipe, the website immediately begins playing a video version of the recipe, similar in style to the kind of video you would find on Facebook. This does likely vary from recipe to recipe, as the page also links to an offsite source for the full recipe. The page does include a recipe list, but to get the actual instructions, a link must be clicked to unhide the rest of the content. Below the recipe, and also to the whole left side of the page, there are various suggested recipes that users could view.</p>
            <p>Yummly takes a much less focused and curated approach than the New York Times did. The website’s front page is a visual overload. Not only is there little whitespace, giving the page a claustrophobic feel, but there’s also 3 redundant repeated elements that show up constantly for every recipe. Individual recipes also immediately force a video on the user, which isn’t a great way to try and follow a recipe. The written instructions are behind an additional click, which further remove emphasis from the cooking process. One thing the website does have going for it is the ability to discover related recipes. There are related recipes on each recipe, which is a nice touch missing from the New York Times website. That said, Yummly takes the idea of suggestion to the extreme, and could do with toning back that aspect overall.</p>
