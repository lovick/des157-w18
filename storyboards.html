            <p>My first iteration just showed a general scenario in which someone could use my potential final project to discover a new kind of food that they hadn't heard of. It gives a decent idea of a use case for the project, but doesn't actually show much of how or what the application would do. In fact, one of the pieces of feedback that I got was that it currently seems like the person could've just used Wikipedia to discover new kinds of foods, and that why someone would use the website isn't as clear as it could be.</p>

            <h2>Second Iteration</h2>
            <img src="images/page2.png" alt="Second iteration of the storyboard" >
            <p>The second iteration includes more of what the application does, and what the outcome of using the project would be.  It also shows some of the basic idea for the actual user interface, which helps to give more of an impression of how the application works. The feedback received here was that more details regarding the functionality of the app and the ways in which it presents people with new kinds of food. How does it find those foods, and how does it choose which ones to show to the end user?</p>
