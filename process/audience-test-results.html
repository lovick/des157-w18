            <h1>Audience Test Results</h1>
            <h2>Audience Experiences</h2>
            <p>I tasked my potential audience with completing 3 tasks: Finding Chinese Recipes, finding a Cheeseburger recipe, and filtering to show only the vegetarian options. Most users were able to accomplish these tasks, but there were a few issues surrounding the completion of these tasks that caused issues. Each user attempted to use the browser's back button in order to step back up a level from viewing a specific culture's cuisine. This led to them leaving the website. There were also some comments regarding the color scheme and overall layout, saying it was functional but not necessarily attractive. 2 of 3 did make a comment saying they were now hungry, which I consider to be a success. There was some overall slight confusion on the purpose of the website, but most people seemed to get the general purpose.</p>

            <h2>Potential Improvments</h2>
            <p>Most importantly, I need to fix that issue with the back button. I believe there's a way to artifically inject pages into the browser history, and append things to the url without loading the page. This should allow me to keep the "web app" type style while still enabling perma-linking and the use of the back button.</p>
            <p>Some commented that the filtering seemed a little arbitrary. Ideally, this will expand to not only allow filtering based on the tags of a recipe, but also based on the ingredients involved in the recipe. May need to refactor how ingredients are stored.</p>
            <p>The other main change I'd like to make would be to improve the overall aesthetic and design of the website. It's functional now, but that's about all it is. The emphasis should remain on the food, but there are ways to make it feel more polished than it currently does.</p>
