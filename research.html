                <h1>Food Background Resarch</h1>
                <h2>Advertising appeals as a reflection of culture: a cross-cultural analysis of food advertising appeals in China and the US</h2>
                <p>This article contrasts the way food is advertised in the United States with the way it is advertised in China. The way food is advertised is both representative of and significantly influential of the way it is viewed culturally. They chose to compare the United States with China largely due to the obvious cultural differences, but also because both countries use social media to a massive degree. Citizens of both also spend higher percentages than most on their food: Chinese spend about 40% of their disposable income on food and beverages, while the US spends about 10% of their overall income.</p>
                <p>The results of the investigation to the differences between these two cultures showcase the clear differences. American advertising trends to focus more on individualism and unique food. Appeals are targeted to convince that something will be an experience for the individual, something that they can say they’ve tried. This contrasts the values found in Chinese advertisements: they tend to focus more on family, community, and popularity. There’s more of a focus on being a part of something greater, whether in the greater culture or just locally. Interestingly, Chinese culture seems to focus more on the value or status of a cuisine. This starkly differs from the emphasis on cheap and quick food in American culture. There also seems to be more focus on health and nutrition in Chinese culture.</p>

                <h2>Food, self and identity</h2>
                <p>This article speaks to a variety of topics about the deeper meanings and aspects of food. Firstly, what it dubs the omnivore’s paradox speaks to the challenge and benefit we have from our opportunity to eat a variety of things. We must eat a variety of foods to get all of the nutrients we need. There’s a potential evolutionary danger in trying new things. This contrasts with creatures like the koala bear, who can eat eucalyptus leaves all day. There’s also an aspect of incorporating the things we eat into our bodies not only in nutrients but also in some element of self-identity. Someone who identifies as vegan likely has a fundamentally different identity from someone who regularly eats meat. Our cultural representation reflect these incorporations as well; baguettes have a uniquely French association.</p>
                <p>The article further talks about the ways in which we cook and combine raw ingredients to form something more tasty and less disgusting, while simultaneously making the raw ingredients less healthy. Additions of salt and sugar to dishes exhibit this perfectly. From a rational perspective, we should prioritize the health and nutrients, yet we desire food that also tastes good.</p>

                <h2>The Role of Regional Food Festivals for Destination Branding</h2>
                <p>Food plays a significant role in marketing a region to those outside. It provides a unique point to gravitate toward; something to identify the destination. Food can vary significantly from culture to culture, so it makes a clear marketing point to engage tourists. Regional food festivals can do this as well. They provide an excuse for potential tourists to visit a given region at a given time, as food can be a major draw for many people. Having a well known festival or food export can strengthen the brand of a town or area. For example, my first thought when I hear Gilroy is the Gilroy Garlic Festival, and I also think about wine any time someone mentions the Napa Valley. These associations can fester and build a desire to visit over time.</p>
