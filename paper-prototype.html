            <h2>First Iteration</h2>

            <p>The feedback I received on my initial prototype was fairly straightfoward, partially because I provided a slightly too simple task. They said I should swap the order of the search bar and the recipes/restaurants toggle. I also gathered that there should be some form of feedback on clicking a link that's already active, like the "recipe" tab. I also had stupidly forgotten to include an image of the recipe on the recipe page.</p>

            <h2>Second Iteration</h2>
            <img src="images/p2-1.png" alt="Paper Prototype 2 Pt 1" >
            <img src="images/p2-2.png" alt="Paper Prototype 2 Pt 2" >
            <img src="images/p2-3.png" alt="Paper Prototype 2 Pt 3" >
            <p>The second iteration had some better feedback. They thought the recipe icons read as categories due to the "culture" labels that I had added. Categories here isn't a bad idea, but it'll need some modification. It would also be a good thing to include a way to filter by a variety of categories. Genre, time of day, kind of food, and geographic areas were some of the suggestions. They also advised adding a header to the whole page; what the website does is unclear without one. They also thought a map for geopgraphic filtering would be an interesting feature.</p>
